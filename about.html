<h1>5k</h1>
<p>
This run will include all Eastlake students in P.E to walk down to skyline and prepare to run the 5k.
The path starts at skyline and follows down the street until they hit the trail.
Follow the trail down til you hit the neighborhood
Once at the neighborhood, take the road down to the back exit of Eastlake and run through the finish line.
At the end of the 5k, the Skyline students will be walking back while the Eastlake students get changed into their normal clothes and grab food to eat.
